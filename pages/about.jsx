            <h6>Hello, I'm Kuki, the artist behind the scenes, and I'm thrilled to take you on a journey through my world of creativity!</h6>
            <br /><br />
    
            <p>Ever since I could hold a pencil, all I wanted to do was scribble, color, and draw "cool" things to show my mom, 
            who always supported me despite the green suns, blue-faced mermaids, and disfigured shapes that I initially drew. 
            I can proudly say that I have improved since then, thankfully, and my passion for art has only grown with time. 
            I have dabbled in different media and explored various forms of art over many years and learned a lot. However, 
            the most important thing I have realized is that I never want to stick to one art form and limit myself. Instead, 
            I want to keep exploring and creating unique things along the way.
            <br /><br />
            In my store, you will find a wide range of products, including 3D printed art (which I began when I was in school 
            for engineering), jewelry, sculptures, keychains, and many more to come (I do hope to incorporate electronics into
            my art very soon). I also enjoy creating art inspired by things I'm passionate about, such as video games, Studio Ghibli, 
            Disney-related themes, and more. Despite the various media I work with and the diverse inspirations and themes I base my art 
            on, they all share one common element - they are made with love and care (yes, it may sound cliché, but I genuinely mean it). 
            Each piece involves hours, if not days, of painstaking work, ensuring that no two pieces are 100% alike or mass-produced. 
            Instead, each one is unique and one of a kind. Additionally, I carefully select high-quality materials to craft products 
            that will last, allowing you to enjoy your piece of art for as long as possible.
